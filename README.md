# Algorand-NTF-Python-SDK

Instructions

1. **Create Algorand Accounts**:
   - First, make sure to have two Algorand accounts (addresses). Sample addresses are provided in the code, but it's recommended to create new ones for testing.

2. **Install Algorand SDK**:
   - Install the Algorand Python SDK to interact with the Algorand blockchain using the following pip command:
     ```
     pip install py-algorand-sdk
     ```

3. **Testing on Testnet**:
   - It's recommended to run the code on the Algorand Testnet. Make sure each account is funded before attempting transactions, as each action requires a small amount of Algos.
   - You can use the Algorand Testnet Faucet to add funds to your accounts.

4. **Additional Information**:
   - All other necessary details are provided in the code comments.
